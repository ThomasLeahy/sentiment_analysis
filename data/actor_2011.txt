Thank you. Ouais! I love your country. Okay. Thank you to the Academy. It's funny because in 1929 it wasn't Billy Crystal but Douglas Fairbanks who hosted the first Oscar ceremony. Tickets cost five dollars and it lasted fifteen minutes. Times have changed. So thank you, Douglas Fairbanks. Yes, Melissa, your grandfather's spirit and joie de vivre inspired me for this role. And so many of you here tonight have inspired me. Thank you, Michel. Thank you for this incredible gift. Thank you, my wonderful partner, BÃ©rÃ©nice Bejo. Thank you, the wonderful cast and crew. My wife, I love you. Kisses, Simon, Jules, Chloe. And if George Valentin could speak, he'd say: Wouaou! Putain! Genial! Merci! Formidable! Merci beaucoup! I love you!
