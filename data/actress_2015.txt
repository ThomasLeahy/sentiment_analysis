Thank you. Thank you first to the Academy. I want to start big because the thing that I love about moviemaking is how many people it takes to make it. So I want to start first with the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto Film Festival, who gave us a chance, who gave us a platform first. I'd like to thank A24 for taking this movie into their hands and sharing it with the world. I'd like to thank our director Lenny Abrahamson, who is absolutely incredible. Emma Donoghue, who created this world. Jacob Tremblay, my partner through this in every way possible. My real partner, Alex Greenwald; I love you the whole thing. To my parents, my agent, my manager, Chris Fioto, Anne Woodward, Lindsay Galin, the rest of my team, my friends, my family. Thank you to everyone who participated in "Room." Thank you to all of you who saw it. Thank you to the fans. Thank you to the moviegoers. Thank you for going to the theater and seeing our films. I appreciate it. Thank you.
