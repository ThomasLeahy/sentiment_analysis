I've got my purse in one hand, my earring in the other. Thank you, Academy. Thank you so much. Huge honor. You know my sister told me that all kids love to get gold stars and this is the biggest and the best gold star that I have ever had in my life. I want to share my gold star with my fellow nominees, those brilliant, brilliant actresses who gave such amazing performances this year. I also share my gold star with the filmmakers: with Stephen Frears, with Peter Morgan, with Andy Harries, and all the producers and all the filmmakers and the cast. Thank you.

Now, you know for fifty years and more Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty and her hairstyle. She's had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head, her handbag on her arm and she's weathered many, many storms. And I salute her courage and her consistency and I thank her, because if it wasn't for her, I most, most certainly would not be here. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Queen. Thank you. Thank you very much.
