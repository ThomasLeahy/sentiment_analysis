Thank you so much.  Yes, now I have to think.  David Hare, I need your words. I have such appreciation and gratitude for this.  Russell Crowe said don't cry if you get up there, and now I'm crying.  Sorry.

Stephen Daldry, you took a huge chance on me.  I am so grateful.  David Hare, you gave me magnificent words to say.  Scott Rudin, you fought so hard for this film, to get it made.  Paramount and Miramax, you made it.  And Kevin Huvane, Rick Nicita, Marc Epstein stood by me for so many years.  And I am just absolutely thrilled to be standing up here tonight.

I do have to say it was, why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil?  Because art is important.  And because you believe in what you do and you want to honor that.  And it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.  At the same time you say there is a lot of problems in the world. And since 9/11 there's been a lot of pain, in terms of families losing people, and now with the war, families losing people.  And God bless them. And I am standing here in front of my mother and my daughter and my whole life I've wanted to make my mother proud.  And now I want to make my daughter proud.  So thank you.
