My deepest thanks to the Academy and its members for this glorious prize. I owe this and so much more to so many. I have lived in America for the longest time and I am deeply greatly to her for the loves and the friendships I have made and the many wonderful gifts it has given me. My home, my livelihood, my family, and an Oscar. I would just like to salute sir Winston Churchill who has been marvelous company on what can be describe as an incredible journey and my wife Giselle for traveling that road with me and being at my side. I would like to thank my mother who is older than the Oscar, she is 99 years young next birthday and she’s watching the ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother – thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I’m bringing Oscar home.
