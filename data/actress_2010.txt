Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much to the Academy.  This is insane and I truly, sincerely wish that the prize tonight was to get to work with my fellow nominees.  I'm so in awe of you.  I am so grateful to get to do the job that I do.  I love it so much.  I want to thank my parents, who are right there, first and foremost for giving me my life and for giving me the opportunity to work from such an early age, and showing me every day how to be a good human being by example.

And I want to thank my team who works with me every day.  Aleen Keshishian, my manager for eighteen years.  And my agents, Kevin Huvane and everyone at CAA.  Bryna and Tamar at I/D.  My friends, who are everything to me no matter what's going on in my career.  And everyone who's ever hired me:  Luc Besson, who gave me my first job when I was eleven years old; Mike Nichols, who has been my hero and my champion for the past decade; and now Darren Aronofsky. You are a fearless leader, a visionary.  I am blessed to have just gotten to get to work with you every day for the period of time we did.

So many people helped me prepare for this role.  Mary Helen Bowers spent a year with me, training me.  Michelle Rodriguez, and Kurt Froman, and Olga Kostritzky, Marina Stavitskaya, and my beautiful love, Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the film and has now given me my most important role of my life. And also there are people on films that no one ever talks about that are your heart and soul every day.  Margie and Geordie, who did my hair and makeup; Nicci, who dressed me; and Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who designed the beautiful ballet costumes.  Joe Reidy, our incredible AD, first AD.  And our camera operators, J.C. and Steve, you gave me so much soul behind the camera every day and you gave me all of your energy.  Most importantly, my family, my friends, and my love.  Thank you so much.
