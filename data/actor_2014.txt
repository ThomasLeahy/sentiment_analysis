Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the Academy. I don't think I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now. Please know this, I am fully aware that I am a lucky, lucky man. This, this Oscar... wow!  This Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world battling ALS. It belongs to one exceptional family:  Stephen, Jane, Jonathan and the Hawking children. And I will be its custodian. And I will promise you I will look after him â€“ I will polish him; I will answer his beck and call; I will wait on him hand and foot. But I would not be here were it not for an extraordinary troupe of people. My staggering partner in crime, Felicity Jones. My ferocious and yet incredibly kind director, James Marsh. Working Title, Focus, Lisa and Anthony, Nina, and my ingenious team of Dallas, Josh, Gene, Jason, Elan, Carl*, Britney* and Carrie and Pip. Now, finally, please, this is so extraordinary. I just want to thank my family and you, Hannah, my wife. I love you so much. We have a new fella comin' to share our apartment. Thank you.
