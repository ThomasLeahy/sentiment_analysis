I have a feeling my career has just peaked.  My deepest thanks to the Academy.  I'm afraid I have to warn you that I'm experiencing stirrings, somewhere in the upper abdominals, which are threatening to form themselves into dance moves which, joyous as they may be for me, it would be extremely problematic if they make it to my legs before I get offstage.  So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude.

First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this.  All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are.  Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be.  And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen:  Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation.

And all the people who have been rooting for me back home.  Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones.  And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this.  And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family.  And Livia, for putting up with my fleeting delusions of royalty and who I hold responsible for this, and for really everything that's good that's happened since I met her.  Now, if you'll all excuse me I have some impulses I have to tend to backstage.  Thank you very much [unintelligible].
