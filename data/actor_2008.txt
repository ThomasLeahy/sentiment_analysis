Thank you.  Thank you.  You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!  I did not expect this, but I, and I want it to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often.  But I am touched by the appreciation and I hoped for it enough that I did want to scribble down so I had the names, in case you were commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns.  And so I want to thank my best friend, Sata Matsuzawa*.  My circle of long-time support:  Mara, Bryan, Barry and Bob.  The great Cleve Jones.  Our wonderful writer, Lance Black. Producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks.  And particularly, as all us actors know, our director either has the patience, talent and restraint to grant us a voice or they don't, and it goes from the beginning of the meeting through the cutting room.  And there is no finer hands to be in than Gus Van Sant.

And finally, for those--two last finallies.  For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support.  We've got to have equal rights for everyone.  And there are, and there are these last two things.  I'm very, very proud to live in a country that is willing to elect an elegant man president and a country who, for all its toughness, creates courageous artists, and this is in great due respect to all the nominees, but courageous artists who, despite a sensitivity that sometimes has brought enormous challenge, Mickey Rourke rises again and he is my brother.  Thank you all very much.
