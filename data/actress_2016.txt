Thank you so much to the Academy. To the women in this category â€“ Natalie, Isabelle, Meryl, Ruth â€“ you were all so extraordinary, and I look up to you and I admire you more than I can put into words. It has been the greatest honor just to stand alongside you; that is the greatest honor of all. To my mom and my dad and my brother Spencer and my soul sister Chrissy* and my whole family, I love you so much. Thank you for everything. And to Doug Wald, who stood by me all these years, and to Holly and Michelle and Craig and P.J. and Greta and Bob Cooper, thank you so much. And I realize that a moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity and so I want to thank Damien Chazelle for the opportunity to be part of a project that was so special and once in a lifetime. I'm so grateful to have been involved in this film. And thank you for your faith and your patience and such a wonderful experience. And Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and for always raising the bar and for being the greatest partner on this crazy adventure. To our whole crew, everyone that put their heart and souls into this film, I'm gonna find you all individually and I'm gonna thank you, along with my friends who I love so much, I am gonna hug the hell out of you when the feeling reenters my body. I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do, and this guy is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey and I am so grateful for that. So thank you so much. Thank you.
