Whew!  My grandfather's name was Stan Wemyss.  He was a cinematographer in the second World War.  My uncle David, David William Crowe, he died last year at the age of sixty-six.  I'd like to thank the Academy for something which is pretty surprising and dedicate it to two men who still continue to inspire me. I'd also like to thank my mum and dad, who I just don't thank enough, I suppose.

And an incredible cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Moeller, Spencer Treat Clark, the magnificent Richard Harris, the late Oliver Reed, Tomas Arana, Tommy Flanagan, Derek Jacobi and everybody else. DreamWorks, a great company and a vital and andrenalized contributor to the art form.  To Doug Wick, David Franzoni, Bruno Lustig and Terry Needham, and a very brave crew collected from twenty-two different countries around the world.  To the people that work for me, who work with me, my personal cavalry: George Freeman, Alan Hergott, Larry Witzer, Shirley Pearce, Robin Baum, Mark Dumbrell.  But really folks, you know, I owe this to one bloke and his name is Ridley Scott.  You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland, or Newcastle like Ridley or Jamie Bell, or the suburbs of anywhere, you know, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable.  But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imagining[s]. And for anybody who's on the down side of advantage and relying purely on courage, it's possible.  Thanks very much.
