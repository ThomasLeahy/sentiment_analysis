Whew!  My grandfather's name was Stan Wemyss.  He was a cinematographer in the second World War.  My uncle David, David William Crowe, he died last year at the age of sixty-six.  I'd like to thank the Academy for something which is pretty surprising and dedicate it to two men who still continue to inspire me. I'd also like to thank my mum and dad, who I just don't thank enough, I suppose.

And an incredible cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Moeller, Spencer Treat Clark, the magnificent Richard Harris, the late Oliver Reed, Tomas Arana, Tommy Flanagan, Derek Jacobi and everybody else. DreamWorks, a great company and a vital and andrenalized contributor to the art form.  To Doug Wick, David Franzoni, Bruno Lustig and Terry Needham, and a very brave crew collected from twenty-two different countries around the world.  To the people that work for me, who work with me, my personal cavalry: George Freeman, Alan Hergott, Larry Witzer, Shirley Pearce, Robin Baum, Mark Dumbrell.  But really folks, you know, I owe this to one bloke and his name is Ridley Scott.  You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland, or Newcastle like Ridley or Jamie Bell, or the suburbs of anywhere, you know, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable.  But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imagining[s]. And for anybody who's on the down side of advantage and relying purely on courage, it's possible.  Thanks very much.

Two birds in one night, huh?  Oh, God is good.  God is great.  God is great. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all.  Forty years I've been chasing Sidney [Poitier], they finally give it to me, what'd  they do?  They give it to him the same night.  I'll always be chasing you, Sidney.  I'll always be following in your footsteps.  There's nothing I would rather do, sir.  Nothing I would rather do.  God bless you.  God bless you.

I want to thank the Academy.  You know, when I was in college first starting out as an actor, they asked each one of us what we wanted to do.  I said I want to be the best actor in the world.  All the students in the classroom looked at me like I was a nut.  Life has taught me to just try and be the best that I can be, and I thank the Academy for saying to me that on this given night I was the best that I could be.  I want to thank Warner Bros. and Alan Horn and Lorenzo di Bonaventura for supporting this film.  And Antoine Fuqua, a brilliant young filmmaker, African-American filmmaker.  I don't know where you are, Antoine, love you.  Ethan Hawke, my partner in crime.  So many people, I can't even remember everybody, lawyers, doctors, agents...  My beautiful agent, Ed Limato.  We've been together for so many years.  Hometown boy from Mount Vernon.  My beautiful wife.  I love you so much.  You put up with me, in spite of myself.  And my beautiful children at home.  I told you if I lost tonight I would come home and we'd celebrate and if I won tonight I would come home and we'd celebrate.  Well, I'm coming home, we're celebrating. God bless you all.

Kisses presenter Halle Berry]  I bet they didn't tell you that was in the gift bag.

Oh my God.  Thank you.  Thank you, really.  Oh my goodness.  It doesn't come out in slow motion, but it doesn't really ring a bell--the name.  I didn't know my name when you said that.  This Adrien?  Okay.

I haven't really written a speech because every time I wrote a speech for the past one of these things I didn't win.  But, you know, there comes a time in life when everything seems to make sense and this is not one of those times. What I do know, though, is that I've never felt this much love and encouragement from my peers and from people I admire and from complete strangers. And it means a great deal to me.  And if it weren't for the insomnia and those sudden panic attacks, this has been an amazing, amazing journey.

I have to thank--they're already flashing time's up--I have to thank my mother and father, most importantly, for all the creativity and the encouragement.  And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.

What can I say?  This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman.  And this is a tribute to his survival.  I'd like to thank Roman Polanski for the role of a lifetime.  And for those of you who have seen the film and sat through the credits, you know there are just too many people to thank individually.  I would not be here without all their efforts.  And I thank them.  And everyone worked extremely hard to make this film.  And I have to thank Focus Features for getting us out there.  To my longtime friend, manager, agent, consigliere, Joanne Colonna.  Everybody at The Firm, PMK/HBH.  And you know...[music plays].  Wait one second.  One second, please, one second.  Cut it out, cut it out.  I get one shot at this. I'm sorry.  I didn't say more than five names I don't think, but...

This is, you know, it fills me with great joy, but I am also filled with a lot of sadness tonight because I'm accepting an award at such a strange time. And, you know, my experiences in making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people at times of war, and the repercussions of war.  And whomever you believe in, if it's God or Allah, may He watch over you.  And let's pray for a peaceful and swift resolution.  Thank you.  And I have a friend from Queens who's a soldier in Kuwait right now, Tommy Zarabinski.  And I hope you and your boys make it back real soon.  God bless you, guys.  I love you.  Thank you very much.

Thank you.  If there's one thing that actors know--other than that there weren't any WMDs--it's that there is no such thing as "best" in acting.  And that's proven by these great actors that I was nominated with, as well as the Giamattis, Cages, Downey Jrs., Nicholsons, etc., that were not nominated.  We know how great all of you were.  My daughter Dylan and son Hopper find it presumptuous and embarrassing to write a speech, and so I'm gonna give it a go without.  God, I really thank Clint Eastwood professionally and humanly for coming into my life.  The great, great cast that I had to work with, my friends.  Where do you go?  Dennis Lehane, Brian Helgeland.  Ma.  Dad.  Robin, for being an undying emotional inspiration on this roller coaster I'm learning to enjoy.  Thank you all very much.

Wow. I guess we got to do it again. [Sings:] "Oooh!"  [Audience repeats back.]  [Sings:] "Aaah!"  [Audience repeats back.]  Yeah, you're ready. That's the Ray Charles.  Give it up for Ray Charles and his beautiful legacy. And thank you, Ray Charles, for living.

I got so many people to thank tonight. And first I'm going to start it out with Taylor Hackford. Taylor, you took a chance, man.  I mean that love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. And it's cracked open and it's spilling, and everybody's drowning in this love.  I thank you for taking a chance on this film. And thank you for waiting fifteen years to get me to do it.  I want to thank you; I want to thank Crusader.

I want to thank my agents. I want to thank Rick Kurtzman.  I want to thank Kim Hodgert. I want to thank Steve Smooke. I want to thank my managers Jaime King and Marcus King. Let's live this African-American dream. It's beautiful. I'm glad I'm with you and I ain't never leaving you. So I love you.

I got a chance to meet a whole lot of people, experiencing this. And other people I want to thank, I want to thank my sister; four foot eleven of nothing but pure love.  I want to thank my daughter for telling me just before I got up here, "If you don't win, Dad, you're still good."

I see Oprah and I see Halle and I just want to say your names.  I want to talk to you later.  Both of you.  Because Oprah allowed me to meet somebody by the name of Sidney Poitier. And Sidney Poitier said [mimicking his voice], "I saw you once.  And I looked in your eyes and there was a connection."  And he says, "I give to you responsibility."  So I'm taking that responsibility tonight.  And thank you, Sidney.

This is probably going to be the toughest part of this speech.  My daughter shares my grandmother's name:  Marie.  My grandmother's name is Estelle Marie Talley.  And she's not here tonight.  And this is going to be the toughest part.  But she was my first acting teacher.  She told me, "Stand up straight. Put your shoulders back.  Act like you got some sense."  We would go places and I would wild out, and she says, "Act like you've been somewhere."  And then when I would act the fool, she would beat me.  She would whup me.  And she could get an Oscar for the way she whupped me because she was great at it. And after she whipped me, she would talk to me and tell me why she whipped me, said, "I want you to be a southern gentleman."  And she still talks to me now; only now she talks to me in my dreams.  And I can't wait to go to sleep tonight because we got a lot to talk about. I love you.

Wow, I'm in a category with some great, great, great actors.  Fantastic actors.  And I'm overwhelmed, I'm really overwhelmed.  I'd like to thank Bill Vince and Caroline Baron and Danny Rosett, the film wouldn't have happened without them.  I'd like to thank Sarah Fargo.  I'd like to thank Sara Murphy. I'd like to thank Emily Ziff.  My friends, my friends, my friends.  I'd like to thank Bennett Miller and Danny Futterman, who I love, I love, I love, I love, I love.  You know the Van Morrison song, I love, I love, I love, and he keeps repeating it like that?  And I'd like to thank Tom Bernard and Michael Barker, thank you so much.

And my mom's name is Marilyn O'Connor, and she's here tonight.  And I'd like if you see her tonight to congratulate her, because she brought up four kids alone and she deserves a congratulations for that.  Ah, we're at the party, ma, you know?  And she took me to my first play and she stayed up with me and watched the NCAA final four, and my passions, her passions became my passions. And, you know, be proud, mom, because I'm proud of you and we're here tonight and it's so good.   Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Just a second, just a second.  Okay.  Take it [in], okay.  I wrote something down because I thought if it would happen I would be a little overwhelmed and I am.  So, okay.

When I was a kid the only way that I saw movies was from the backseat of my family's car at the drive-in, and it wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies.  So receiving this honor tonight tells me that it's possible, it is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in South Central L.A., in Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen.  Because when I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us.  Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it's a connection so strong, it's a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.

So I want to thank my fellow believers in "The Last King of Scotland."  I want to thank Peter, Jeremy, Andrea, Lisa, Charles, Kevin, James McAvoy, Kerry, Stephen, Fox, DNA, Channel Four.  I want to thank the people of Uganda, who helped this film have a spirit.  And finally, I want to thank my mom and my dad; I want to thank my wife Keisha, my children, my ancestors who continue to guide my steps, and God, God who believes in us all and who's given me this moment in this lifetime that I will hopefully carry to the end of my lifetime into the next lifetime.  Thank you.

That's the closest I'll ever come to getting a knighthood, so thank you.  My deepest thanks to the members of the Academy for whacking me with the handsomest bludgeon in town.

I'm looking at this gorgeous thing that you've given me and I'm thinking back to the first devilish whisper of an idea that came to him and everything since and it seems to me that this sprang like a golden sapling out of the mad, beautiful head of Paul Thomas Anderson.  I wish my son and my partner, HW Plainview, were up here with me, the mighty Dillon Freasier.  So many people to thank.  One amongst them would be Mrs. Plainview, down there, the enchantingly optimistic, open-minded and beautiful Rebecca Miller.  I hope that all those to whom I owe and to whom I feel the deepest gratitude will forgive me if I say just simply:  Thank you, Paul.

I've been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and I'd like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Michael Balcon; my father, Cecil Day Lewis; and my three fine boys, Gabriel, Ronan and Cashel. Thank you very much indeed.  Thank you.

Thank you.  Thank you.  You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!  I did not expect this, but I, and I want it to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often.  But I am touched by the appreciation and I hoped for it enough that I did want to scribble down so I had the names, in case you were commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns.  And so I want to thank my best friend, Sata Matsuzawa*.  My circle of long-time support:  Mara, Bryan, Barry and Bob.  The great Cleve Jones.  Our wonderful writer, Lance Black. Producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks.  And particularly, as all us actors know, our director either has the patience, talent and restraint to grant us a voice or they don't, and it goes from the beginning of the meeting through the cutting room.  And there is no finer hands to be in than Gus Van Sant.

And finally, for those--two last finallies.  For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support.  We've got to have equal rights for everyone.  And there are, and there are these last two things.  I'm very, very proud to live in a country that is willing to elect an elegant man president and a country who, for all its toughness, creates courageous artists, and this is in great due respect to all the nominees, but courageous artists who, despite a sensitivity that sometimes has brought enormous challenge, Mickey Rourke rises again and he is my brother.  Thank you all very much.

Oh!  Thank you, Academy members!  Mom and Dad, yeah, look!  Whoo!  Thank you, Mom and Dad, for turning me on to such a groovy profession.  Oh, my dad, my mom, they loved show biz so much.  I remember my mom getting all of us kids to entertain at her parties, you know, my dad sitting me on his bed and teaching me all of the basics of acting for a role in "Sea Hunt."  They loved show biz so much and I feel an extension of them, you know, this is honoring them as much as it is me.

I wanna thank Scott Cooper, our wonderful director, for his knowledge of film and country music, and for his ability to instill self-confidence in his actors.  I thank you for that, Scott.  Where are you?  Raise your hand, man. Yeah!  Scotty!  Thank you for that, Scott man!  And thank you for assembling such a wonderful cast.  Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin, wherever he is backstage, and Bobby Duvall.  So wonderful, you guys brought your heart and soul.  I want to thank Barry Markowitz, our wonderful DP, did such a brilliant job.  Judy Cairo, our producer, and Fox Searchlight, our wonderful distributor.  Thank you, guys, for keeping us all together and for making it all happen.  T Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton, for bringing all of that great music and those wonderful musicians to the party, man.  And my wonderful team that's kept me together:  Jean Sievers, David Schiff, Rick Kurtzman at CAA, Bob Wallerstein, Loyd Catlett, Tarra Day and Roger Love, man.  Thank you, guys.

And I especially want to thank my gorgeous wife, Sue.  We've been married thirty-three years.  We have a beautiful family, three girls:  Isabelle, Jessie and Hayley.  Thank you, guys.  I wouldn't be up here without you. Thank you so much.

I have a feeling my career has just peaked.  My deepest thanks to the Academy.  I'm afraid I have to warn you that I'm experiencing stirrings, somewhere in the upper abdominals, which are threatening to form themselves into dance moves which, joyous as they may be for me, it would be extremely problematic if they make it to my legs before I get offstage.  So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude.

First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this.  All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are.  Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be.  And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen:  Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation.

And all the people who have been rooting for me back home.  Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones.  And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this.  And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family.  And Livia, for putting up with my fleeting delusions of royalty and who I hold responsible for this, and for really everything that's good that's happened since I met her.  Now, if you'll all excuse me I have some impulses I have to tend to backstage.  Thank you very much [unintelligible].

Thank you. Ouais! I love your country. Okay. Thank you to the Academy. It's funny because in 1929 it wasn't Billy Crystal but Douglas Fairbanks who hosted the first Oscar ceremony. Tickets cost five dollars and it lasted fifteen minutes. Times have changed. So thank you, Douglas Fairbanks. Yes, Melissa, your grandfather's spirit and joie de vivre inspired me for this role. And so many of you here tonight have inspired me. Thank you, Michel. Thank you for this incredible gift. Thank you, my wonderful partner, BÃ©rÃ©nice Bejo. Thank you, the wonderful cast and crew. My wife, I love you. Kisses, Simon, Jules, Chloe. And if George Valentin could speak, he'd say: Wouaou! Putain! Genial! Merci! Formidable! Merci beaucoup! I love you!

I really don't know how any of this happened. I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that "Lincoln" shouldn't be a musical.

My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago â€“ or since we got married sixteen years ago â€“ my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men. I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she's the versatile one in the family and she's been the perfect companion to all of them. I'd like to thank Kathy Kennedy, our producer, and through you, Kathy... and through you, our mighty team of co-conspirators. At the apex of that human pyramid there are three men to whom I owe this and a great deal more: Tony Kushner; our beloved skipper Steven Spielberg; and the mysteriously beautiful mind, body and spirit of Abraham Lincoln. For my mother. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc VallÃ©e, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.

There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, "When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you."

To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers â€“ demanded â€“ that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.

And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, "Who's your hero?" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, "Who's your hero?" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, "So, are you a hero?" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, "Why?" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.

So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you.
Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the Academy. I don't think I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now. Please know this, I am fully aware that I am a lucky, lucky man. This, this Oscar... wow!  This Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world battling ALS. It belongs to one exceptional family:  Stephen, Jane, Jonathan and the Hawking children. And I will be its custodian. And I will promise you I will look after him â€“ I will polish him; I will answer his beck and call; I will wait on him hand and foot. But I would not be here were it not for an extraordinary troupe of people. My staggering partner in crime, Felicity Jones. My ferocious and yet incredibly kind director, James Marsh. Working Title, Focus, Lisa and Anthony, Nina, and my ingenious team of Dallas, Josh, Gene, Jason, Elan, Carl*, Britney* and Carrie and Pip. Now, finally, please, this is so extraordinary. I just want to thank my family and you, Hannah, my wife. I love you so much. We have a new fella comin' to share our apartment. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you all so very much. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances. "The Revenant" was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. First off, to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tom Hardy. Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen. To Mr. Alejandro IÃ±Ã¡rritu, as the history of cinema unfolds you have forged your way into history these past two years. What an unbelievable talent you are. Thank you to you and Chivo for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us. Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency, in particular Arnon Milchan. You were the champion of this endeavor. My entire team.  I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career. Mr. Caton-Jones, for casting me in my first film. Mr. Scorsese, for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To Mr. Rick Yorn, thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. And to my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly; you know who you are.

And lastly, I just want to say this. Making "The Revenant" was about man's relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity. For the indigenous people of the world. For the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this. For our children's children. And for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much.
That means so much to me, thank you. One of the first people who taught me how to act was Denzel Washington, and I just met him tonight for the first time. Thank you. And to all the other nominees, you did great work. I'm proud to be in your company. You guys are very brave and I admire what you do. I'm only here, really, because of all the talents and goodwill of so many people; they're impossible to name. But most of all Kenneth Lonergan, who made this part, and without this part and without his writing I wouldn't be here for sure. And well, he directed it. Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say, but I'm just, I'm really proud to be a part of this community in general. I look out at all of you, I have this whole year, and I'm just dumbfounded that I'm included. It means a lot to me. Thank you also to Matt Damon for creating this opportunity. To Mara Buxbaum, for so much. And to Patrick and Boomer, and so many people. Of course my mother and my father, for mostly, usually, believing in me in doing this. And Ben, I love you; you ain't heavy. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it.
My deepest thanks to the Academy and its members for this glorious prize. I owe this and so much more to so many. I have lived in America for the longest time and I am deeply greatly to her for the loves and the friendships I have made and the many wonderful gifts it has given me. My home, my livelihood, my family, and an Oscar. I would just like to salute sir Winston Churchill who has been marvelous company on what can be describe as an incredible journey and my wife Giselle for traveling that road with me and being at my side. I would like to thank my mother who is older than the Oscar, she is 99 years young next birthday and she’s watching the ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother – thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I’m bringing Oscar home.
Oh, thank you, thank you ever so much.  I'm so happy.  Thank you.  I have a television, so I'm going to spend some time here to tell you some things.  And sir [speaking to music conductor Bill Conti], you're doing a great job, but you're so quick with that stick.  So why don't you sit, 'cause I may never be here again.

I would like to start with telling you all how amazing the experience of feeling the sisterhood of being included in a group with Joan Allen and Juliette Binoche and Laura Linney and Ellen Burstyn for these last weeks has been.  It's just felt like such a triumph to me to be in that list.  My name starts with "R" so I'm always last, but I still love the list.  But I can't believe this, this is so [looking at the Oscar]... this is quite pretty.

I want to acknowledge so many people that made "Erin Brockovich," "Erin Brockovich" -- but let me make my dress pretty [adjusts the train of her dress].  Universal, everybody at Universal, Kevin Misher and Stacey Snider and Stacey Sher -- and I can't believe I'm remembering everybody's name.  Jersey Films, Danny DeVito, and everybody over there.  Everyone I've ever met in my life.  This movie was sinfully fun to make, and Albert Finney is my friend and my pleasure to act with.  And Aaron Eckhart and Scotty and Gemmenne and Brittany and Ashley, all the wonderful actors that played my children.  And Marg Helgenberger -- and turn that clock off, it's making me nervous.  Greg Jacobs, everybody on our crew that was so great.  And, well, just a few other people...  But really, the main person -- well, Richard LaGravenese and Susannah Grant who wrote such a nice script.

Steven Soderbergh -- hi, there you are -- you truly just made me want to be the best actor that I suppose I never knew I could be, or aspire to.  And I made every attempt -- Stick-man, I see you.  So I thank you for really making me feel so... [laughs!]  I love it up here!  Yeah, anyway, I start working for him again in two days, so I can get to you later.  But Benjamin Bratt, my sister Lisa, my brother-in-law Tony.  Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who's been my agent since God was a boy.  Jeff Berg.  My mom!  And just Frances* and Marcus and Mike and everybody who's watching at home.  Kelly, Emma, everybody.  I love the world!  I'm so happy!  Thank you!

Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I'm sorry.  This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll.  It's for the women that stand beside me, Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox.  And it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.  Thank you.  I'm so honored.  I'm so honored.  And I thank the Academy for choosing me to be the vessel for which His blessing might flow.

I want to thank my manager, Vincent Cirrincione.  He's been with me for twelve long years and you fought every fight, and you loved me when I've been up but more importantly you've loved me when I've been down.  You have been a manager, a friend and the only father I've ever known.  Really.  And I love you very much.  I want to thank my mom who has given me the strength to fight every single day to be who I want to be and to give me the courage to dream, that this dream might be happening and possible for me.  I love you, Mom, so much.  Thank you, my husband, who is just a joy of my life.  And India, thank you for giving me peace because only with the peace that you've brought me have I been allowed to go to places that I never even knew I could go.  Thank you.  I love you and India with all my heart.

I want to thank Lions Gate.  Thank you, Mike Paseornek, Tom Ortenberg, for making sure everybody knew about this little tiny movie.  Thank you for believing in me.  Our director Marc Forster, you're a genius.  You're a genius.  This moviemaking experience was magical for me because of you.  You believed in me, you trusted me and you gently guided me to very scary places. I thank you.  I want to thank Ivana Chubbuck, I could have never figured out who the heck this lady was without you.  I love you.  Thank you.  I want to thank Lee Daniels, our producer.  Thank you for giving me this chance, for believing that I could do it.  And now tonight I have this.  Thank you.

I want to thank my agents.  CAA, Josh Lieberman especially.  I have to thank my agents.  Kevin Huvane, thank you.  Thank you for never kicking me out and sending me somewhere else.  Thank you.  Um...   I, I, I, who else?  I have so many people that I know I need to thank.  My lawyers!  Neil Meyer, thank you. Okay, wait a minute.  I got to take... seventy-four years here!  I got to take this time!  I got to thank my lawyer Neil Meyer for making this deal. Doug Stone.  I need to thank lastly and not leastly, I have to thank Spike Lee for putting me in my very first film and believing in me.  Oprah Winfrey, for being the best role model any girl can have.  Joel Silver, thank you.  And thank you to Warren Beatty.  Thank you so much for being my mentors and believing in me.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

Thank you so much.  Yes, now I have to think.  David Hare, I need your words. I have such appreciation and gratitude for this.  Russell Crowe said don't cry if you get up there, and now I'm crying.  Sorry.

Stephen Daldry, you took a huge chance on me.  I am so grateful.  David Hare, you gave me magnificent words to say.  Scott Rudin, you fought so hard for this film, to get it made.  Paramount and Miramax, you made it.  And Kevin Huvane, Rick Nicita, Marc Epstein stood by me for so many years.  And I am just absolutely thrilled to be standing up here tonight.

I do have to say it was, why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil?  Because art is important.  And because you believe in what you do and you want to honor that.  And it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.  At the same time you say there is a lot of problems in the world. And since 9/11 there's been a lot of pain, in terms of families losing people, and now with the war, families losing people.  And God bless them. And I am standing here in front of my mother and my daughter and my whole life I've wanted to make my mother proud.  And now I want to make my daughter proud.  So thank you.

This has been such an incredible year.  I can't believe this.  I don't have a lot of time.  I have to thank my incredible director Patty Jenkins.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  All of our producers, Brad, Clark, Meagan, Mark, Donald, Sammy Lee, everybody at Media 8, Bob and everybody at Newmarket, thank you so much for working so hard on this film.  My incredible, incredible leading lady Christina Ricci, who I couldn't have done this film without.  You are truly the unsung hero of this film.  I have to thank our entire crew, Toni G for transforming me so incredibly, every single person who worked on this film.  I couldn't have done it without you guys.  My incredible manager J.J. Harris, who has represented me for so long now.  And you've always believed in me.  I can't thank you enough.  My friend Steve Warren, my lawyer, thank you so much. Yes, I know.  He's my friend.  Heidi Schaeffer and Amanda Silverman from PMK.  My guardian angel Beth Kono.  My producing partner Meagan Riley-Grant.  And if I'm forgetting anybody, please, don't kill me.  And I know everybody in New Zealand has been thanked so I'm going to thank everybody in South Africa, my home country.  They're all watching tonight and I'm bringing this home next week.  And I have to thank my incredible partner in crime.  You're one hell of a partner to have.  Thank you so much for standing by me.  And my mom.  You've sacrificed so much for me to be able to live here and make my dreams come true and there are no words to describe how much I love you.  And I'm not gonna cry.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

I don't know what I did in this life to deserve all this. I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream. I never thought this would ever happen, let alone be nominated. And a working actor, for that matter. And now, this. I thank the Academy. I am eternally grateful for this great honor. I would also like to acknowledge my fellow nominees. Annette, Imelda, Kate and Catalina, your work inspires me beyond words.

I am going to start by thanking my husband because I'd like to think I learn from past mistakes. Chad, you're my everything. Thank you for your support. It means the world. I would never be standing here if it weren't for each and every one of the brilliant people I had surrounding me, supporting me and believing in me. Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, thank you for sending me this most marvelous script. You will never know how grateful I am. Paul Haggis, for writing this beautiful script. Our other producers extraordinaire: Al Ruddy, Clint, Rob Lorenz. Phyllis Huffman, our casting director. My trainers, Grant Roberts and HÃ©ctor Roca, you pushed me further than I ever thought I could push myself, up to that last pound, actually to that last ounce. I thank you. My sparring partners who were so patient. And everyone at Gleason's. Well, the ever-amazing Morgan Freeman. Tom Stern, our cinematographer, you are brilliant. Joel Cox, our editor, you're amazing. You know? I'm going to thank my mom for believing in me from the beginning; my dad for his support. My agents: Josh Lieberman, Tony Lipp, Kelly Tiffan, John Campisi. Jason Weinberg, my manager. [Music begins to play.]  Uh uh, you can't do that, because I haven't gotten to Clint yet. I saved him for the end. Karl Austen, Jeff Bernstein, my lawyers.

And then... Clint. Clint Eastwood, thank you for allowing me to go on this journey with you. Thank you for believing in me. You're my "Mo Cuishle." Thank you.

Alan Horn and Warner Bros., as well, thank you. [Music starts up again.] And you know what? Wait! Troy Nankin!  Troy Nankin, my best friend and publicist! Thank you!

Oh my goodness.  I never thought I'd be here in my whole life, growing up in Tennessee.  I want to say that Johnny Cash and June Carter had a wonderful tradition of honoring other artists and musicians and singers, and I really feel that tradition tonight.  It is very important and I really feel it, so I want to thank the Academy for this incredible honor.

I want to say thank you to so many people who helped me create this role. Everyone at Fox; Cathy Konrad, James Keach for producing the film.  A very special thank you to Jim Mangold who directed the film and also wrote this character who is a real woman who has dignity and honor and fear and courage. And she's a real woman and I really appreciate that.  It was an incredible gift that you gave me, so thank you.  And T Bone Burnett for helping me realize my lifelong dream of being a country music singer; thank you, T Bone. And I want to say thank you to Joaquin Phoenix who just put his heart and soul into this performance.  His commitment and passion for this character and for this performance was just remarkable and I feel so lucky to have gone on this journey with you.

I am so blessed to have my family here tonight.  My mother and my father are here.  And I just want to say thank you so much for everything, for being so proud of me.  It didn't matter if I was making my bed or making a movie, they never hesitated to say how proud they were of me and that means so very much to a child.  So thank you, Mom and Dad.  I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband and my two childrenâ€”who should be going to bedâ€”and thank you for loving me so much and supporting me.  And I want to say that my grandmother was one of the biggest inspirations in my life.  She taught me how to be a real woman, to have strength and self respect, and to never give those things away.  And those are a lot of qualities I saw in June Carter.  And people used to ask June how she was doing, and she used to say: "I'm just trying to matter."  And I know what she means.  You know, I'm just trying to matter and live a good life and make work that means something to somebody. And you have all made me feel that I might have accomplished that tonight. So thank you so much for this honor.

I've got my purse in one hand, my earring in the other. Thank you, Academy. Thank you so much. Huge honor. You know my sister told me that all kids love to get gold stars and this is the biggest and the best gold star that I have ever had in my life. I want to share my gold star with my fellow nominees, those brilliant, brilliant actresses who gave such amazing performances this year. I also share my gold star with the filmmakers: with Stephen Frears, with Peter Morgan, with Andy Harries, and all the producers and all the filmmakers and the cast. Thank you.

Now, you know for fifty years and more Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty and her hairstyle. She's had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head, her handbag on her arm and she's weathered many, many storms. And I salute her courage and her consistency and I thank her, because if it wasn't for her, I most, most certainly would not be here. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Queen. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Oh, thank you so much.  Olivier, what you did to me, Maestro Olivier Dahan. You rocked my life.  You've truly rocked my life.  Thank you so much to Picturehouse for your passion.  Members of the Academy, thank you so, so much! And wow, well I'm speechless now.  I, I, well â€“ Thank you life, thank you love, and it is true, there is some angels in this city.  Thank you so, so much.
Okay, that fainting thing, PenÃ©lope.  I'd be lying if I haven't made a version of this speech before.  I think I was probably eight years old and staring into the bathroom mirror and this [holding up her statuette] would've been a shampoo bottle.  Well, it's not a shampoo bottle now!  I feel very fortunate to have made it all the way from there to here and I'd like to thank some of the people along the way who had faith in me.  My friends and my family, especially my mum and dad, who are in this room somewhere.  Dad, whistle or something, 'cause then I'll know where you are.  [Loud whistle.] Yeah!  I love you!

I also want to thank Hylda Queally, Dallas Smith and the late, much loved, much missed Robert Garlock.  And from Peter Jackson and Emma Thompson to my very own Sam and Stephen Daldry.  I'm very lucky to have been given "Hanna Schmitz" by Bernhard Schlink and David Hare.  And Stephen, working with you is an experience I will never forget.  There was no division between the cast and the crew on this film, and that's what made it so special.  So, to have been surrounded by a remarkable group of people who provided an unbroken chain of support, from David Kross to Ralph Fiennes, Bruno Ganz, Lena Olin, from hair and makeup to cinematography, from the art department to the ADs, and from New York to Berlin.  And I'm so lucky to have a wonderful husband and two beautiful children who let me do what I love and who love me just the way that I am.

Anthony [Minghella] and Sydney [Pollack], this is for you.  This is for both of you.  And I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees, these goddesses.  I think we all can't believe we're in a category with Meryl Streep at all.  I'm sorry, Meryl, but you have to just suck that up!  And just to the Academy, thank you so much.  My God!  Thank you!
Did I really earn this or did I just wear you all down?  I would like to thank the Academy for allowing me in the last month to have the most incredible ride, with rooms full of artists that I see tonight and that I've worked with before and I hope to work with in the future, who inspire me and blaze trails for us.  Four of them, that I've fallen deeply in love with, I share this night with and I share this award with.  Gabby, I love you so much. You are exquisite.  You are beyond words to me.  Carey, your grace and your elegance and your beauty and your talent makes me sick.  Helen, I feel like we are family, through(?) family, and I don't have the words to express just what I think of you.  And Meryl, you know what I think of you, and you are such a good kisser.

I have so many people to thank for my good fortune in this lifetime, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I know.  To the family that allowed me to play them, the Tuohy family.  I know they're in here and you'll probably hear her in a minute... Maybe not. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different:  John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you.  To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago.  I'm still holding a grudge.

But there's so many people to thank; not enough time.  So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from.  Those moms and parents never get thanked.  I, in particular, failed to thank one.  So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do.  For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be.  She said to be an artist you had to practice every day.  And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else.  We are all deserving of love.  So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep.  Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much to the Academy.  This is insane and I truly, sincerely wish that the prize tonight was to get to work with my fellow nominees.  I'm so in awe of you.  I am so grateful to get to do the job that I do.  I love it so much.  I want to thank my parents, who are right there, first and foremost for giving me my life and for giving me the opportunity to work from such an early age, and showing me every day how to be a good human being by example.

And I want to thank my team who works with me every day.  Aleen Keshishian, my manager for eighteen years.  And my agents, Kevin Huvane and everyone at CAA.  Bryna and Tamar at I/D.  My friends, who are everything to me no matter what's going on in my career.  And everyone who's ever hired me:  Luc Besson, who gave me my first job when I was eleven years old; Mike Nichols, who has been my hero and my champion for the past decade; and now Darren Aronofsky. You are a fearless leader, a visionary.  I am blessed to have just gotten to get to work with you every day for the period of time we did.

So many people helped me prepare for this role.  Mary Helen Bowers spent a year with me, training me.  Michelle Rodriguez, and Kurt Froman, and Olga Kostritzky, Marina Stavitskaya, and my beautiful love, Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the film and has now given me my most important role of my life. And also there are people on films that no one ever talks about that are your heart and soul every day.  Margie and Geordie, who did my hair and makeup; Nicci, who dressed me; and Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who designed the beautiful ballet costumes.  Joe Reidy, our incredible AD, first AD.  And our camera operators, J.C. and Steve, you gave me so much soul behind the camera every day and you gave me all of your energy.  Most importantly, my family, my friends, and my love.  Thank you so much.

Oh my god. Oh, c'mon! Oh! Alright. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I -- when they called my name I had this feeling I could hear half of America going, "Oh no! Oh, c'mon why? Her? Again?" You know? But, whatever. [Laughs]

First I'm going to thank Don, because when you thank your husband at the end of the speech they play him out with the music, and I want him to know that everything I value most in our lives you've given me. And now secondly, my other partner. Thirty-seven years ago, my first play in New York City, I met the great hairstylist and makeup artist Roy Helland. And we worked together pretty continuously since the day we clapped eyes on each other. His first film with me was "Sophie's Choice," and all the way up to tonight when he won for his beautiful work in "The Iron Lady" thirty years later. Every single movie in between. And I just want to thank Roy, but also I want to thank -- because I really understand I'll never be up here again. I really want to thank all my colleagues, all my friends. I look out here and, you know, I see my life before my eyes: my old friends, my new friends. And really, this is such a great honor, but the thing that counts the most with me is the friendships and the love and the sheer joy we have shared making movies together. My friends, thank you, all of you, departed and here, for this, you know, inexplicably wonderful career. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Thank you. You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell and that's really embarrassing, but thank you. This is nuts.

Thank you to the Academy and thank you to the women this year. You were so magnificent and so inspiring, and not just those of you in my category. And it has been so amazing getting to know you. And you've been so nice and you've made this experience unforgettable. And thank you to the best producing team: Bruce, Donna, Jon. And to my team at CAA and I/D PR. And Bradley, and our entire cast â€“ Chris, Jacki, Bob â€“ and our crew. And my family. Happy birthday, Emmanuelle. Thank you so much. Thanks.
Sit down; you're too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis. From you it exacerbates this honor to it and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary â€“ yet again â€“ extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in "American Hustle" blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.

And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that "Blue Jasmine" stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!

Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of "Blue Jasmine," I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in "Blue Jasmine," I thank you so much.

And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on "Blue Jasmine," it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia, and Michael Wilkinson and CM and I are just tonight's tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you so much. I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer. If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.

I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did. And finally, for my husband Bart and our children, Cal and Liv, thank you for my life, thank you for giving me a home. Thank you very much for this.

Thank you. Thank you first to the Academy. I want to start big because the thing that I love about moviemaking is how many people it takes to make it. So I want to start first with the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto Film Festival, who gave us a chance, who gave us a platform first. I'd like to thank A24 for taking this movie into their hands and sharing it with the world. I'd like to thank our director Lenny Abrahamson, who is absolutely incredible. Emma Donoghue, who created this world. Jacob Tremblay, my partner through this in every way possible. My real partner, Alex Greenwald; I love you the whole thing. To my parents, my agent, my manager, Chris Fioto, Anne Woodward, Lindsay Galin, the rest of my team, my friends, my family. Thank you to everyone who participated in "Room." Thank you to all of you who saw it. Thank you to the fans. Thank you to the moviegoers. Thank you for going to the theater and seeing our films. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Thank you so much to the Academy. To the women in this category â€“ Natalie, Isabelle, Meryl, Ruth â€“ you were all so extraordinary, and I look up to you and I admire you more than I can put into words. It has been the greatest honor just to stand alongside you; that is the greatest honor of all. To my mom and my dad and my brother Spencer and my soul sister Chrissy* and my whole family, I love you so much. Thank you for everything. And to Doug Wald, who stood by me all these years, and to Holly and Michelle and Craig and P.J. and Greta and Bob Cooper, thank you so much. And I realize that a moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity and so I want to thank Damien Chazelle for the opportunity to be part of a project that was so special and once in a lifetime. I'm so grateful to have been involved in this film. And thank you for your faith and your patience and such a wonderful experience. And Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and for always raising the bar and for being the greatest partner on this crazy adventure. To our whole crew, everyone that put their heart and souls into this film, I'm gonna find you all individually and I'm gonna thank you, along with my friends who I love so much, I am gonna hug the hell out of you when the feeling reenters my body. I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do, and this guy is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey and I am so grateful for that. So thank you so much. Thank you.

So, I think this is what Chloe Kim must have felt like after doing back to back 1080s in the Olympic half pipe, did you see that? Okay, that's what it feels like. I want to thank Martin McDonagh, look what you did. We are a bunch of hooligans, and anarchists, but we do clean up nice. I want to thank every single person in this building. And my sister, Dorothy, I love you, Dot. And I especially want to thank my clan.
Joel and Pedro McCoen, these two stalwart individuals were well-raised by their feminist mothers. They value themselves, each other and those around them. I know you are proud of me, and that fills me with everlasting joy. And now, I want to give some perspective. If I may be so honored to have all the female nominees in every category stand with me in this room tonight. The actors—Meryl, if you do it everyone else will—the filmmakers, the producers, the directors, the writers, the cinematographers, the composers, the song writers, the designers. Come on! Okay, look around everybody, look around, ladies and gentleman because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don’t talk to us about it at the parties tonight. Invite us into your office in a couple days or you can come to ours, whichever suits you best, and we can tell you all about them. I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentleman, inclusion rider.
