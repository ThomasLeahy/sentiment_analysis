Thank you.  If there's one thing that actors know--other than that there weren't any WMDs--it's that there is no such thing as "best" in acting.  And that's proven by these great actors that I was nominated with, as well as the Giamattis, Cages, Downey Jrs., Nicholsons, etc., that were not nominated.  We know how great all of you were.  My daughter Dylan and son Hopper find it presumptuous and embarrassing to write a speech, and so I'm gonna give it a go without.  God, I really thank Clint Eastwood professionally and humanly for coming into my life.  The great, great cast that I had to work with, my friends.  Where do you go?  Dennis Lehane, Brian Helgeland.  Ma.  Dad.  Robin, for being an undying emotional inspiration on this roller coaster I'm learning to enjoy.  Thank you all very much.
