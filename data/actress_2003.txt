This has been such an incredible year.  I can't believe this.  I don't have a lot of time.  I have to thank my incredible director Patty Jenkins.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  All of our producers, Brad, Clark, Meagan, Mark, Donald, Sammy Lee, everybody at Media 8, Bob and everybody at Newmarket, thank you so much for working so hard on this film.  My incredible, incredible leading lady Christina Ricci, who I couldn't have done this film without.  You are truly the unsung hero of this film.  I have to thank our entire crew, Toni G for transforming me so incredibly, every single person who worked on this film.  I couldn't have done it without you guys.  My incredible manager J.J.
