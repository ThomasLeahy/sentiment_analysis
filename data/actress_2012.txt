Thank you. You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell and that's really embarrassing, but thank you. This is nuts.

Thank you to the Academy and thank you to the women this year. You were so magnificent and so inspiring, and not just those of you in my category. And it has been so amazing getting to know you. And you've been so nice and you've made this experience unforgettable. And thank you to the best producing team: Bruce, Donna, Jon. And to my team at CAA and I/D PR. And Bradley, and our entire cast â€“ Chris, Jacki, Bob â€“ and our crew. And my family. Happy birthday, Emmanuelle. Thank you so much. Thanks.
